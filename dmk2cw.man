.SH Name
dmk2cw \- Write a DMK floppy disk image file onto a disk
using a Catweasel controller
.SH Syntax
.B dmk2cw [options] filename.dmk
.SH Description
The dmk2cw program uses the Catweasel universal floppy disk controller
to write a floppy disk image to an actual disk.  The image file is
expected to be in the DMK format first used by some TRS-80 Model
I/III/4/4P emulators.  If you have a JV1 or JV3 image to write to disk,
run jv2dmk on it first.

The DMK image is exactly reproduced on disk, as far as
possible, including the positioning and spacing of sectors and the
content of gaps.  Thus even so-called copy protected disks can be
written correctly and should work on the hardware they were made for.
Currently, dmk2cw can write all formats that can be written by the
Western Digital 177x/179x disk controllers used in the original TRS-80
machine, all formats that can be written by the NEC 765-compatible
floppy disk controllers used in PCs, and the Digital Equipment
Corporation RX02 format.  Even formats that mix FM (single density)
and MFM (double/high density) on the same track can be written.

The dmk2cw program usually guesses the drive type and disk format to
be written by measuring the rotational speed of the drive (300 or 360
RPM) and checking the track length and other fields in the DMK file,
but you can override this with command line arguments if needed.  
The program does not automatically double-step if you are writing
a 40-track disk in an 80-track drive, however; see the -m flag for this.
Also, if you are using a single sided drive, see the -s flag.

Versions of dmk2cw exist for both Linux and MS-DOS.  On Linux, dmk2cw
must be run as root.  If the program is made setuid to root, it drops
its root privileges as soon as it has obtained access to the block of
I/O ports it needs to directly access the Catweasel.  On Windows 95,
dmk2cw.exe can be run in an MS-DOS Prompt box.  On plain MS-DOS,
cw2dmk.exe needs the program cwsdpmi.exe (included) to provide DPMI
functionality; make sure it is in the same directory as cw2dmk.exe or
in another directory on your path.

dmk2cw accesses the hardware directly, so it must not be used at the
same time as any other Catweasel software.  In particular, on Linux,
do not load Michael Krause's "cwfloppy" driver at the same time, and
on MS-DOS, do not load the "catbase" driver that comes with the
Catweasel.

.SH Options
.TP
.B \-d \fIdrive\fP
Specify the drive unit number, 0 or 1.  Default: 0.
.TP
.B \-v \fIverbosity\fP
Specify how much output is printed.  Larger numbers select more output.
The default setting is 1.
.RS
.TP
0
No output.
.TP
1
Print progress information.
.TP
2
Also dump the bytes being written, prefixing each with the encoding used.
This option is primarily for debugging purposes.
The prefixes used are as follows: "-" means the byte is skipped
(it was padding in the DMK file), "F" encoded as FM data,
"I" encoded as an FM index address mark, "A" encoded as an FM data address
mark or ID address mark, "M" encoded as MFM data, "J" encoded as an MFM
pre-index address mark, "B" as an MFM pre-data or pre-ID address mark,
and "X" as RX02-modified MFM data.
.TP
3
Like 2, but also dump the Catweasel samples generated for each byte.
This option is primarily for debugging purposes.
.RE
.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fP
For the Catweasel MK1 (ISA), port should be the I/O port base, or
0 to default to the factory setting of 0x320.  For the Catweasel 
MK3 or MK4 (PCI),
port should be 0 for the first Catweasel card in the machine, 1 for the
second, etc.  The default is 0.
.TP
.B \-k \fIkind\fP
Specify the type of drive and type of media in use.  This option is
usually not needed, as dmk2cw will typically guess correctly.
.RS
.TP
1
5.25-inch SD/DD disk in 1.2MB drive
.TP
2
5.25-inch SD/DD disk in 360KB/720KB drive, or 3.5-inch SD/DD disk 
.TP
3
5.25-inch HD disk, or 8-inch SD/DD disk
.TP
4
3.5-inch HD disk
.RE
.TP
.B \-m \fIsteps\fP
Step multiplier, 1 or 2.  A step multiplier of 2 is used when writing
a 40-track (or 35-track) disk in an 80-track drive.  Default: 1.  If
you set -m2, you should bulk-erase the media first to eliminate
residual magnetization from the odd numbered tracks that may cause
problems when the disk is read in a 40-track drive.
.TP
.B \-s \fIsides\fP
Maximum number of sides, 1 or 2.  Use -s1 if your physical floppy drive
has only one head (that is, if it can only write to side 0 of the disk).
If you forget to do this and the DMK file has space reserved for side 1
data (even if there are no valid sectors in that space), dmk2cw will
overwrite the side 0 data on each track of the media with the side 1 data.
.P
The remaining options usually do not need to be changed from their
default values.
.TP
.B \-c \fIclock\fP
Catweasel sample rate multiplier.  1 selects 7.080 MHz (about 140 ns),
2 selects 14.161 MHz (about 70 ns), and (on Catweasel MK3 and MK4 only) 4
selects 28.322 MHz (about 35 ns).  Default: 2.
.TP
.B \-o \fIplo[,phi]\fP
Specifies the number of nanoseconds to advance or retard transitions
for write precompensation.  The actual distance between transitions is
always rounded to a multiple of the Catweasel clock period (-c
option), so it is pointless to make adjustments much finer than that
value.  If one value is given, the same precompensation is used on all
tracks. If a pair of values plo,phi is given, plo is used on track 0
and phi on the highest track, with tracks between interpolated
linearly.  Default: 140ns.

Exactly what does this option do?  The magnetic flux transitions on a
floppy disk tend to move slightly farther apart if they are recorded
very close together, thus lengthening the short intervals and
shortening the long ones, a phenomenon sometimes called bit-shifting.
When a disk is recorded, the disk controller ordinarily applies write
precompensation to reduce this effect; that is, it makes the short
intervals extra short and the long ones correspondingly longer,
especially on the inner, higher-numbered tracks.  In dw2dmk, if the
shortest legal interval appears immediately to the left (or right) of
a longer one, the flux transition between them is moved to the left
(or respectively, right).

In general, disks need more precompensation on the inner
(higher-numbered) tracks than on the outer tracks, and this effect is
more pronounced for larger disks where the difference in length
between the inner and outer tracks is greater.  The default value of
140ns for all tracks seems to work reasonably well on 3.5-inch and
5.25-inch disks, though it is surely not optimal.  For 8-inch disks, a
few experiments with the cwtsthst program suggest that -o70,700 is a
good value -- it makes tracks 1 and 76 have much more similar
histograms than if a constant value is used.  If you have trouble
reading disks written by dmk2cw with a regular floppy disk controller,
try using cwtsthst to compare track histograms of natively-written
media that read successfully in your controller with media written by
dmk2cw.  If there is a substantial difference, try different -o values
to see if you can get dmk2cw to write disks that are more similar to
the native disks.
.TP
.B \-h \fIhd\fP
For -h0 or -h1, set the HD line on the floppy bus to the indicated
value.  For -h2, set the HD line on the floppy bus to 0 for tracks 0
to 43, to 1 for tracks greater than 43.  For -h3, set the HD line on the
floppy bus to 1 for tracks 0 to 43, to 0 for tracks greater than 43.  For
-h4 (the default), the line is set according to the disk kind (-k
flag); to 0 for -k1 and -k2; to 1 for -k3 and -k4.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlen\fP
Causes dmk2cw to ignore any data beyond the first len bytes in
the DMK image of each track.  This option is applied before -g or -i.
It has no effect if len is greater than the track data length recorded in
the DMK image.
.TP 
.B \-g \fIigno\fP
Causes dmk2cw to ignore the first igno bytes 
in the DMK image of each track.  If igno is negative, an extra -igno bytes
of padding are inserted at the beginning of each track.
.TP
.B \-i \fIipos\fP
If this option is given, dmk2cw forces the first IAM
(index address mark) encountered on each track to be exactly ipos bytes from
the physical start of the track, by ignoring bytes or adding padding 
at the start of the track as with the -g flag.  The default is -1, which
disables this feature, instead recording the gap exactly as in the image.
Note that if you set ipos too small, there will not be enough bytes in the
initial gap for the IAM to be recognized when the disk is read.
.TP
.B \-r \fIreverse\fP
If reverse is 1, dmk2cw reverses the sides of the disk; that is, it
writes side 0 of the DMK file to physical side 1 of the disk and side
1 of the DMK (if any) to physical side 0 of the disk.  The default is
0, which does not reverse the sides.  This option is most likely to be
useful if you want to write a separate 1-sided DMK image to each side
of a disk in a double-side drive.  You can do this by running dmk2cw
twice, first writing the head 0 image using -s1 -r0, then the head 1
image using -s1 -r1.
.TP
.B \-f \fIfill\fP
If the track data being written (after possibly being shortened by the
above options) is not sufficient to fill the physical track, dmk2cw
writes the rest of the physical track with a fill pattern.  By
default (with fill = 0), if the last data byte of the track was
encoded in FM or RX02, the fill pattern is 0xff encoded in FM; if
the last data byte was encoded in MFM, the fill pattern is 0x4e
encoded in MFM.  With fill = 1, dmk2cw erases the remainder of
the track and writes nothing (not available on Catweasel MK1 or MK3).
With fill = 2, the fill pattern is a sequence of very long
transitions, which also effectively erases the remainder of the
track.  With fill = 3, there is no fill; the Catweasel stops
writing at the end of track, leaving whatever was previously on the
disk intact.  With fill = 0x1nn, the fill pattern is 0xnn encoded
in FM.  With fill = 0x2nn, the fill pattern is 0xnn encoded in
MFM.
.TP
.B \-a \fIrate_adj\fP
Causes dmk2cw to multiply the average data rate by rate_adj (default
1.0).  Values should be close to 1.0; for example, 1.005 makes the
data rate 0.5 percent faster, while 0.995 makes it 0.5% slower.
Making the data rate 1% faster has a similar effect to running the
drive motor %1 slower: more data fits on the track.  Of course if the
data rate is adjusted to be too far off from the standard value, the
resulting disk may not be readable.
.TP
.B \-e \fIdither\fP
If dither is 1, dmk2cw adjusts the number of Catweasel clock ticks in
the intervals between transitions by +/-1 when needed to keep the
average data rate accurate.  If dither is 0 (the default), no such
adjustment is done.  As a result, the interval sizes are consistent
across the whole track, but the average data rate may be off
(typically by much less than 1%) because of cumulative rounding error.
If a disk needs the -a option to adjust the average data rate very
precisely, turning on dither too may help.  Dither is a relatively new
feature, and it is not yet clear whether it is an improvement idea or
whether the occasional +/-1 tick will make disks more difficult to
read.
.TP
.B \-y \fItestmode\fP
Set various undocumented test modes for debugging.
.SH Diagnostics
.TP
dmk2cw: Error reading from DMK file
The DMK file was opened successfully, but a read from it failed.
.TP
dmk2cw: File is not in DMK format
The specified disk image file was opened successfully, but it was not in
DMK format.  If you have disk images in JV1 or JV3 format, use
jv2dmk to convert them to DMK format before using them with dmk2cw.
.TP 
.B dmk2cw: No access to I/O ports
On Linux, dmk2cw must be made setuid to root or be run as root, or it
will not be able to access the Catweasel's I/O ports and this error
message will appear.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Failed to detect Catweasel
A Catweasel card was not detected at the specified I/O ports.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Drive 0 was not detected, but drive 1 was
.PD 0
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Drive 1 was not detected, but drive 0 was
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Failed to detect any drives
.PD
The specified drive (see -d option) was not detected, or no drives
were detected.  Cabling and drive selection can be confusing, so try
the other drive number before giving up, especially if you saw some
drive activity before this message was printed.  Note: In versions
prior to 3.0, dmk2cw used the opposite drive numbering convention from
the bundled Catweasel software supplied by Individual Computers.  This
has now been corrected.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Disk is write-protected
This message usually means what it says.  A 3.5-inch disk should have its
write-enable slider closed.  A 5.25-inch disk should not have a write-protect
tab covering its notch.  An 8-inch disk should have a write-enable tab
covering the appropriate notch.
It might also appear in some cases if the drive is not connected
properly, the door is not closed, the disk is inserted upside-down, etc.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Failed to guess drive kind; use -k
This message is printed if drive/media autodetection fails.  Either
the drive speed could not be measured, or the track length was not
one of the common values used in most DMK files.  You can
specify the kind of drive and media in use with the -k flag.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: No disk in drive
This message usually means what it says, that there is no disk in the
drive.  It might also appear in some cases if the drive is not connected
properly, the door is not closed, the disk is inserted upside-down, etc.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Write error
Either the drive reported that it was not ready when the Catweasel tried to 
write to it, or no index hole was detected.
This message usually means that there is no disk in the
drive.  It might also appear in some cases if the drive is not connected
properly, the door is not closed, the disk is inserted upside-down, etc.
.TP
.B dmk2cw: Drive is 1-sided but DMK file is 2-sided
This message means that there is space reserved in the DMK file for
two sides, and some apparently valid data was found on side 1, but you
gave the -s1 flag to say that your disk drive is only one-sided.
